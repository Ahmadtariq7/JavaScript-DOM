Hello Guys!

BEFORE STARTING, PLEASE READ THIS OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE GET CONFUSED..

Here is JavaScript & DOM Crash Course from Beginning to almost end.

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT HTML & CSS...

Basically, JavaScript(JS) is shown on console of browser and can learnt in better way from there.

Better to look index.html before looking it to have a idea.

In Javacript/main.js, you can get all course, all reading you wanna do is in comments.just comment out and in and start learning.
Moreover, I also Attached all CONTENTS JS files individually too, so if you want to learn from them, you can too. like variables.js, functions.js etc

After Learing Basics, If you want to learn DOM basics, Go to DOM folder. There you will find DOM.js, page.html, styling.css and some other .js files.
In DOM.js, you can get all course of DOM, you have to comment out and in for learning and test. I better recommend that first learn and test from other .js files in the folder. 
Than come to DOM.js to have final go through.

DOM is Document Object Model basically..

Thanks and Good Luck.
